## 🚨 **IMPORTANT SETTINGS FOR BOT OPERATION** 🚨

---

### 🖥️ **UI SETTINGS**
- **In-game UI scale** must be set to **100%**!
- After setting it to 100%, make sure it's saved correctly (sometimes it saves as 99 or 101 instead).

---

### 🌍 **DISPLAY MODE**
- The bot **cannot** play the fishing mini-game in **Fullscreen** or **Windowed** modes.
- Set your game to **"Fullscreen Windowed"** mode for optimal performance.

---

### 🎮 **GAMEPAD SETTINGS**
- Enable **"Use Gamepad"** in-game settings to let the bot detect fishing icons (A) and mini-game icons.
- This setting affects **only** the fishing icon's detection.

---

### 🔤 **FONT SETTINGS**
- The game uses **"Strong Sword"** font for compatibility.
- To apply:
    - Place the **“prestringtable”** file (from the bot’s files) in your **Black Desert Online** main game folder.

---

### 🎣 **FISHING ICON POSITION**
- The position of the fishing icon may vary by game language.
    - **In the bot window:** Check **“Show Fish Scan Area”** and manually drag the window to adjust the scan area.
    - **In Loot Bot:** Check **“Show Loot Scan Area”** and position the box where loot appears.

---

### 🪟 **WINDOW FOCUS**
- The game may lose focus if the monitor turns off.
    - Go to **“Target Window”** in the Fish Bot, select your game window, and enable **“Keep window focus”**.
    - The bot will check every 10 seconds and bring the window back to the front if necessary.

---

### 🟢 **CUSTOMIZING FISH COLORS**
- Move fish icons into color folders to catch specific colors.
    - Example: If you tick the **Red** box in the bot and place a yellow fish icon in the **red** folder, the bot will catch **both** red and that yellow fish.
  
**COLOR TRANSLATIONS:**
- **baliklar** = fishes
- **red** = kırmızı
- **yellow** = sarı
- **blue** = mavi
- **green** = yeşil

---

### ⏱️ **LOOT BOT - DURATION (SECONDS)**
- **Duration (seconds)** means that if no fish appear within the set time, the bot will stop.
- **Recommended setting:** 120 seconds.

---

### 🔄 **CONTINUE AFTER STOP**
- If you want the bot to continue fishing after stopping:
    - Check **“Continue after Telegram message.”**
    - Telegram notifications are optional; the bot will still work even if you leave the token and chat ID empty.
